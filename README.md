Author: Cheuk Lau

Date: 5/10/2018

In this project, we create a personal portfolio to showcase projects
that we will develop in the Udacity nano-degree. We must use a 
grid-based layout (e.g., Bootstrap or Flexbox) with a fully
responsive design. The website should display on mobile (phone,
tablet) and full desktop devices.

# Software Dependencies
The personal portfolio website should run on all modern browsers.
The website was tested using Firefox and Chrome.

# Compilation Instructions
To open the portfolio website, open index.html in any browser.
